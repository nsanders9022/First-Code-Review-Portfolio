              <p>In high school I worked at a fitness center as a receptionist and a child care attendant</p>
              <p>Throughout the summers during college I worked as an instructor at Lindamood-Bell Learning Processes in Bellevue WA. I provided one-on-one instruction to students who had learning difficulties and disabilities</p>
              <p>After graduating with my master's degree I moved to Portland, OR and continued to work for Lindamood-Bell while looking for a new job.</p>
              <p>Eventually I became an administrative assistant at an architecture firm in Portland </p>

              <p>My master's degree focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics" target="_blank"> Human Factors</a>, often times refered to as UX, which involves applying psychology to design to make the product or software more intuitive for the user. I <strong>really</strong> liked the idea of this field and I wanted to apply the knowledge I had gained at a technology company to help increase the usability of their software products</p>
              <p>After about two years of working at any job I could obtain while trying to get my foot into this field, I finally decided that I needed to focus on learning more hard skills like programming.</p>
              <p>I had taken a Python class during my undergraduate career and a HTML/CSS class in graduate school and greatly enjoyed both courses. While I had plenty of time during my administrative position to teach myself to code using free online resources, I knew that I needed a bootcamp to get me the skills I need to finally get a career as a web developer. <span id="thanks">Thanks Epicodus!</span></p>.

              <p>I have been <strong>extremely</strong> fortunate to have lived abroad during my childhood. I spent 5 years living in Basel, Switzerland and 4 years near London, England</p>
              <p>Growing up abroad instilled in me a love to travel and I have continued with that passion by studing abroad in Florence, Italy for a year as well as taking a couple of internation vacations with my boyfriend over the past few years. I am looking forward to being able to see even more of the world in the future</p>
              <p>I also like to read books and watch TV. My favorite genre is mystery but I'll never turn down the chance to watch Property Brothers or read a John Grisham novel</p>
