              <p>In high school I worked at a fitness center as a receptionist and a child care attendant</p>
              <p>Throughout the summers during college I worked as an instructor at Lindamood-Bell Learning Processes in Bellevue WA. I provided one-on-one instruction to students who had learning difficulties and disabilities</p>
              <p>After graduating with my master's degree I moved to Portland, OR and continued to work for Lindamood-Bell while looking for a new job.</p>
              <p>Eventually I became an administrative assistant at an architecture firm in Portland </p>

              <p>My master's degree focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics" target="_blank"> Human Factors</a>, often times refered to as UX, which involves applying psychology to design to make the product or software more intuitive for the user. I <strong>really</strong> liked the idea of this field and I wanted to apply the knowledge I had gained at a technology company to help increase the usability of their software products</p>
              <p>After about two years of working at any job I could obtain while trying to get my foot into this field, I finally decided that I needed to focus on learning more hard skills like programming.</p>
              <p>I had taken a Python class during my undergraduate career and a HTML/CSS class in graduate school and greatly enjoyed both courses. While I had plenty of time during my administrative position to teach myself to code using free online resources, I knew that I needed a bootcamp to get me the skills I need to finally get a career as a web developer.</p>.

              <p>I have been <strong>extremely</strong> fortunate to have lived abroad throughout my childhood</p>
              <p>Shortly after I was born in New Jersey I moved to Basel, Switzerland for the first time. After living there for a couple years my family and I hopped over the water to settle down in a town an hour north of London England. I began school here and kept my English accent for many years after the four years that we spent in England.</p>
              <p>Next, my family hopped over more water and we landed in New Jersey for another 4 years. Afterwards, we jumped back over to Basel, Switzerland where I spent the most incredible three years getting to make great friends with people from numerous countries and continents</p>
              <p>After three years back in Switzerland my parents had enough of the expat life and settled down in Bellevue, WA, where I attended high school.</p>
              <p>My childhood instilled in me a love to travel and continued with that passion by studing abroad in Florence, Italy for a year as well as taking a couple of internation vacations with my boyfriend over the past few years. I am looking forward to being able to see even more of the world in the future</p>
